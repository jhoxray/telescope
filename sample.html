            <h2>Observatory logging &amp; monitoring sample app</h2>
            <div class="well">
                This is a demo app to illustrate capabilities of the <a href="https://github.com/jhoxray/observatory">Observatory Logging &amp; Monitoring</a> - a package that provides
                powerful logging, inspection and monitoring for your <a href="http://meteor.com">Meteor framework</a> applications. 
                Observatory panel is controlled by pressing the "O!" button in the bottom-left corner of the page: you can have it small, medium,
                large or completely turned off. By moving between tabs you can analyze logs (updated live), your application's templates with
                events, as well as monitor other internals (currently, Session state, more to come).
                Observatory is currently version 0.1.6 and you may find it quite handy in your Meteor app development. We do :)

            <div class="alert"><strong>Note:</strong> this demo app currently features development version of Observatory, in the stable package there's no theme change and module name support yet. It will be released soon.

    <h5>Why?</h5>
            <div class="well">
                We got frustrated with the need to switch between the terminal and Chrome's js console to keep track of Meteor app logs, plus needed a basic standard logging
                package that can support different log levels and present all that in one place in a nice format. Then kinda got carried away. If you
                are thinking "IDE", then yup, that's what we are thinking eventually. Someday. Maybe...
                </div>
                <h5>What does it do?</h5>
            <div class="well">
                <ul>
                <li>Supports different log levels (currently FATAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, VERBOSE) with corresponding methods for message output,
                optional logging to console, pretty output of both Client and Server logs using Twitter Bootstrap right in the browser.
                <li>Provides live monitoring of your app's templates with all events (they tend to become too many very fast, so keeping track of
                    all of them in one place is very useful) and some other internals (currently, Session object)
                </ul>
                </div>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                
                <h5>Usage</h5>
            <div class="well">
                <p>Installation is as easy as<code>mrt add observatory</code>. Also feel free to <a href="https://github.com/jhoxray/telescope">browse the code</a> for this app.</p>
                <p>For details, see <a href="https://github.com/jhoxray/observatory">Observatory package</a> on GitHub,
                but in a nutshell you simply call <br/><code>TL = TLog.getLogger(TLog.LOGLEVEL_MAX,true)</code> once in your app's common
                code (that gets executed on both client and server) and then call the following obvious methods:
                <code>TL.fatal("..."), error, warn, info, verbose</code>.
                <p>To display the main Observatory panel, just plugin <code>logs_bootstrap</code> Handlebars template anywhere in your html pages, 
                    preferrably right before closing "body" tag.
