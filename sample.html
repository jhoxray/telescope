            <h1>Welcome to the Telescope Logger sample app</h1>
            <div class="well">
                This is a simple demo app to illustrate capabilities of the <a href="https://github.com/jhoxray/telescope">Telescope Logger package</a> that provides
                simple logging for the <a href="http://meteor.com">Meteor framework.</a> The actual example of how it looks is right below. Logs are sortable, just
                click on the column title.

    <h5>Why?</h5>
            <div class="well">
                I got frustrated with the need to switch between the terminal and Chrome's js console to keep track of Meteor app logs, plus needed a basic standard logging
                package that can support different log levels and present all that in one place in a nice format.
                </div>
                <h5>What does it do?</h5>
            <div class="well">
                Supports different log levels (currently FATAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, VERBOSE) with corresponding methods for message output,
                optional logging to console, pretty output of both Client and Server logs using Twitter Bootstrap right in the browser.
                </div>
                <h5>Usage</h5>
            <div class="well">
                <p>For details, see <a href="https://github.com/jhoxray/telescope">Telescope Logger package</a> on GitHub (it contains this app and Telescope Logger library),
                but in a nutshell you simply call <br/><code>TL=new TLog(TLog.LOGLEVEL_MAX,true)</code> once in your app's common
                code (that gets executed on both client and server) and then call the following obvious methods:
                <code>TL.fatal("..."), error, warn, info, verbose</code>.
                <p>To display the logs, just plugin <code>logs_bootstrap</code> Handlebars template anywhere in your html pages. E.g., in this app it's in the column to the right.
